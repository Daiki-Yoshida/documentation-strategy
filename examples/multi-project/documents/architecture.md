# Solution Architecture

## Overall Architecture Pattern

### Clean Architecture + Domain-Driven Design
Each microservice follows Clean Architecture principles:
- **Domain Layer**: Business entities, value objects, domain services
- **Application Layer**: Use cases, application services, DTOs
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data access, external services, messaging
- **Presentation Layer**: API controllers, middleware, filters

### Microservices Communication
```
API Gateway (Ocelot)
├── UserService (Port 5001)
├── ProductService (Port 5002)
├── OrderService (Port 5003)
└── SharedLibraries (NuGet packages)
```

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **.NET 8**: Latest LTS version for performance and features
- **C# 12**: Latest language features and syntax
- **ASP.NET Core 8**: Web API framework
- **Entity Framework Core 8**: ORM for database access

### Data Storage
- **SQL Server 2022**: Primary database for each service
- **Redis**: Distributed caching and session storage
- **RabbitMQ**: Message queue for asynchronous communication

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Serilog**: Structured logging
- **AutoMapper**: Object-to-object mapping
- **FluentValidation**: Input validation
- **Polly**: Resilience and fault-tolerance
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: API documentation

## Service Design Patterns

### Database per Service
- Each microservice owns its database
- No direct database sharing between services
- Data consistency through events and eventual consistency

### API Gateway Pattern
- Single entry point for all client requests
- Request routing and load balancing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Services communicate through domain events
- Eventual consistency for cross-service data
- Event sourcing for audit and recovery

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Fault tolerance for service-to-service calls
- Automatic recovery and failover
- Graceful degradation of functionality

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT Bearer tokens for API authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Service-to-service authentication
- API key authentication for external services

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Personal data anonymization
- GDPR compliance framework

## Performance & Scalability

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for distributed caching
- Application-level caching for frequently accessed data
- Database query optimization

### Monitoring & Observability
- Application Insights for telemetry
- Custom metrics for business KPIs
- Distributed tracing for request correlation
- Real-time alerting for critical issues
